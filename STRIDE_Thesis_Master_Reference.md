## Executive Summary

**Thesis Title:** "Multi-Stage Linear Optimization of Energy Components at Freight Forwarding Depots for Electric Trucks"

**Core Contribution:** Developing a sequential multi-stage optimization framework that extends REVOL-E-TION to plan infrastructure investments (PV, battery storage, chargers) over a 30-year horizon (2025-2055) for electric freight truck depots.

**Key Insight:** The thesis value lies NOT in algorithmic complexity but in comprehensive analysis, realistic scenarios, and actionable insights for freight companies transitioning to electric fleets.

---

## 1. Thesis Scope & Positioning

### 1.1 Research Question
How should freight depot operators optimally time and size infrastructure investments (PV, battery storage, charging equipment, grid connections) over 30 years to minimize costs while meeting electric fleet requirements?

### 1.2 What This Thesis IS
- ✅ Sequential multi-stage investment planning framework
- ✅ Extension of existing REVOL-E-TION framework
- ✅ Comprehensive scenario analysis and sensitivity studies
- ✅ Practical recommendations for freight industry
- ✅ Solid engineering master's thesis demonstrating competence

### 1.3 What This Thesis IS NOT
- ❌ Novel optimization algorithm development (PhD-level)
- ❌ Full stochastic programming (too complex for 6 months)
- ❌ Modification of REVOL-E-TION core (use as black box)
- ❌ Real-time operational control system

### 1.4 Research Gap
Existing literature lacks multi-stage planning frameworks for depot electrification that:
- Consider infrastructure investment timing over decades
- Account for technology cost declines
- Handle fleet growth and demand evolution
- Integrate solar PV and stationary storage

---

## 2. Methodology Overview

### 2.1 Approach: Sequential Multi-Stage Optimization

**Core Algorithm (Simplified):**
```python
for stage_year in [2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, 2050]:
    # 1. Set size_existing from previous stage results
    # 2. Update parameters (costs, demand, fleet size)
    # 3. Run REVOL-E-TION optimization
    # 4. Extract optimized capacities
    # 5. Store results for next stage
```

**Key Features:**
- **Sequential** (myopic) rather than simultaneous optimization
- More realistic - companies don't have perfect foresight
- Computationally tractable
- Allows re-evaluation at each stage with updated information

### 2.2 Why Sequential is Appropriate

**Advantages:**
- Reflects real-world decision-making under uncertainty
- Allows adaptation to actual conditions at each stage
- Computationally feasible within master's thesis timeline
- Easier to explain to industry stakeholders

**Justification for Anna:**
> "We employ a sequential multi-stage optimization approach that reflects real-world decision-making under uncertainty, where infrastructure investments are made based on current conditions and updated as new information becomes available."

### 2.3 Operational Optimization via REVOL-E-TION

**REVOL-E-TION provides:**
- Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation
- Hourly dispatch optimization
- Component sizing within each stage
- NPV calculations
- Integration of: PV, stationary battery (ESS), grid connection, EV chargers, vehicle batteries (BEV)

**Your integration:**
- Wrapper layer calls REVOL-E-TION per stage
- Feeds forward capacity decisions
- Aggregates multi-stage NPV

### 2.4 Decision Variables (Per Stage)

**Investment decisions:**
- PV capacity additions [kW]
- Stationary battery capacity additions [kWh]
- Charger quantity additions [units]
- Grid connection capacity upgrades [kW]

**Constraints:**
- Capacity non-decreasing: `size_stage_N+1 ≥ size_stage_N`
- Optional: Budget constraints per stage
- Optional: Maximum growth rates
- Optional: Maximum CO2 emissions
- Optional: Maximum depot space used (for solar panels, wind turbines, etc.)

## 4. REVOL-E-TION Key Learnings

### 4.1 Architecture Understanding

**Core Concepts:**
- **Blocks:** Modular components (PVSource, StationaryEnergyStorage, GridConnection, VehicleCommoditySystem)
- **Strategies:** 
  - `go` (global optimum) - Single optimization for entire period
  - `rh` (rolling horizon) - Sequential optimizations with sliding window
- **Temporal Structure:**
  - `sim_duration` (e.g., 50 days) - Simulation period
  - `prj_duration` (e.g., 25 years) - Project lifetime
  - Results extrapolated from simulation to project duration

**Available Components:**
- ✅ PVSource (solar panels)
- ✅ StationaryEnergyStorage (stationary batteries)
- ✅ GridConnection (grid with bidirectional flow)
- ✅ VehicleCommoditySystem (EVs with V2G)
- ✅ BatteryCommoditySystem (mobile batteries)
- ✅ FixedDemand (depot base load)

### 4.2 Key Parameters

**Investment Control:**
```csv
component,size_existing,0           # Current capacity
component,size_max,None             # No upper limit
component,invest,True               # Enable optimization
component,capex_spec,0.5            # Cost per unit capacity
```

**Economic Parameters:**
```csv
scenario,wacc,0.09                  # Discount rate (9%)
scenario,prj_duration,25            # Project lifetime (years)
scenario,sim_duration,50            # Simulation period (days)
```

### 4.3 Results Interpretation

**From Summary CSV:**
- `size_total` = Total installed capacity (existing + additional)
- `size_additional` = Optimized capacity additions
- `npv` = Net Present Value
- `lcoe_total` = Levelized Cost of Energy ($/Wh, multiply by 1000 for ¢/kWh)
- `capex_sim` = Capital expenditure in simulation period
- `opex_sim` = Operational expenditure in simulation period

**Example Results (from test run):**
- ICEV baseline: LCOE = 20.48 ¢/kWh
- BEV_GRID: LCOE = 17.77 ¢/kWh (EVs cheaper than diesel)
- BEV_MG (with PV): LCOE = 15.65 ¢/kWh (PV reduces costs further)

### 4.4 Why Cyan and Purple Lines Are Opposite

**Energy Balance Principle:**
- Cyan (demand) = negative = energy consumption
- Purple (grid) = positive = energy supply
- Grid supplies exactly what demand needs: `Grid Power = -Demand Power`

## 11. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 11.1 Technical Pitfalls

**❌ Scope creep:** Adding transformer models, demand response, V2G revenue optimization, etc.
- **✅ Solution:** Stick to core: PV, battery, chargers, grid. That's enough.

**❌ Over-engineering:** Building perfectly general framework
- **✅ Solution:** Build for your specific use case. Generalization is PhD work.

**❌ Getting stuck on REVOL-E-TION details:** Trying to modify core
- **✅ Solution:** Treat as black box. Use what's there.

**❌ Analysis paralysis:** Trying to make perfect data
- **✅ Solution:** Use reasonable assumptions, validate against literature, move on.

### 11.2 Writing Pitfalls

**❌ Over-explaining operational optimization:** 20 pages on MILP
- **✅ Solution:** 2-3 pages citing REVOL-E-TION paper. Focus on YOUR contribution.

**❌ Under-explaining decisions:** "We chose 7 stages"
- **✅ Solution:** Justify every choice with reasoning or literature.

**❌ Results without interpretation:** Just tables of numbers
- **✅ Solution:** Every figure needs 1-2 paragraphs explaining what it means and why it matters.

**❌ Missing the "so what?":** Technical results without practical implications
- **✅ Solution:** Always connect to real-world decisions: "This means depot operators should..."

### 11.3 Project Management Pitfalls

**❌ Writing only at the end:** Nothing written until Month 5
- **✅ Solution:** Write methods in Month 2-3, results in Month 4, assemble in Month 5.

**❌ No supervisor alignment:** Building wrong thing for 3 months
- **✅ Solution:** Show Anna progress every 2-3 weeks. Get explicit approval.

**❌ Underestimating data work:** "I'll just use example data"
- **✅ Solution:** Start data gathering in Week 8-9. Takes longer than you think.

**❌ No backup plan:** All eggs in one case study
- **✅ Solution:** Have 3 case studies. If one fails, you have two others.
