# German Grid CO2 Emission Factor Projections
# Source: Compiled from Fraunhofer ISE, FfE, ICIS, Clean Energy Wire
# Date: 2026-01-12
# Units: kg CO2 per kWh (location-based)
#
# Notes:
# - Values represent average annual grid emission factor
# - Projections based on coal phase-out 2030, 80% renewables by 2030
# - Net-zero electricity targeted by 2045 (Germany) / 2050 (EU)
